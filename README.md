# Tableau Assignment - Citi Bike Analytics

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- Tableau

## Procedure
Via Python terminal, execute `CityAPI.py`. This will generate 2 csv files: `stations.csv and stationsStatus.csv`.
These csv files are the data sources for Tableau. Source data for transformation within Python file can be found
at https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/gbfs.md.

## Purpose
Using the NYC City API, we can get a snapshot of current bike availability by station via Python. The resulting csv files
are then visualized in Tableau, providing a geographical representation of availability.
